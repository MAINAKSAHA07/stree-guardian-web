                  Our proprietary electric shock system delivers a precisely controlled 1000V current â€“ strong enough to temporarily immobilize an attacker without causing permanent harm. Unlike tasers, our specialized electrodes are designed for optimal contact through clothing while integrated safety features prevent accidental discharge.
